Summarize the call in json format, including the following fields. All of the fields are required.
If information was not provided by the insurer, leave the field empty.
They should be string values, because insurer may provide some additional details about each field.
Write them in a way that would be easy to understand for a human and would follow official sentence structure.
I need raw json object, without any additional text, markdown, or formatting.
